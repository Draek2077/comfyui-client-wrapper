# Draekz ComfyUI Client Wrapper

NOTE: I have no connection to the ComfyUI team, nor collaborate with them on what I'm doing. This is purely an add-on tool I use as a quality of life thing and share it with others.

This project aims to provide a really simple way to install a ComfyUI client application in windows and have it let you manage multiple tabs without having to mix things
up with the local browser, or with cumbersome systems like web application installs on various browsers.

Client Window:

The project was written entirely using Gemini 2.5 Pro, and is meant to be used by the Draekz ComfyUI Installer which allows easy installation of ComfyUI, the Server Manager, the Client Wrapper, a ton of nodes, models and options right from first install.

The project uses .NET 8.0 for windows, WPF and the WebView2 components to get something that looks integrated easily and quickly. The installer is built using WixToolset.Sdk 6.0.1.
